# Tree Print Project

This project was created for my Data Structures and Algorithms course. It reads a file of integers, creates a binary search tree with those integers, 
and prints a specified range of numbers by searching for them within the BST.

## Functions
* Read an input file and build a BST with the file's integers
* Search and print numbers within the BST that are in a specified range
* Print the tree in ascending order (in order traversal)

## Compiling Instructions
I created this project on Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, so creating a new empty C++ project and 
inserting the files into the Source Files should allow the code to run in Visual Studio. 
You have to put the input.txt file in the Visual Studio project's directory, 
which usually looks something like: `C:\Users\Username\source\repos\Tree_Print\Tree_Print\`
  
I also included a makefile, so the code can run on the Unix command line. The command to run the 
code is `make run`.
